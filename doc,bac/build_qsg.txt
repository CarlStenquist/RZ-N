==== SHORT GUIDE ===============================================

Pull anytime to get the latest updates
$ git clone -b rzn1-stable https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzn1_linux.git

$ cd rzn1_linux/

You should see the 'rzn1-stable' branch.
$ git branch -a

* rzn1-stable
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/rzn1-stable

This branch includes the GOAL Core-to-Core (C2C) driver from port GmbH. OBSERVE: The C2C driver version must match the GOAL Cortex M3 code version

===========================================================


DETAILED GUIDE ============================================
With attached modified code, the clone is added, this should make updates fast. 
Copy everything in rzn1_linux-4.9_bsp to a new directory rzn1_linux-4.9_bsp2, but get rid of the kernel patches directory.
$cd ~/rzn1_linux-4.9_bsp2
The first time you build in a directory you must do
$git init
$./build.sh config
$./build.sh buildroot menuconfig
$mkdir output/buildroot-2017.02/output/rootfs_overlay
$./build.sh buildroot

$./build.sh kernel rzn1_defconfig
Exit and save. After this your configuration will be in the local .config file, and you will subsequently only need do the standard
$./build.sh kernel menuconfig
Change your kernel the way you want it.
$./build.sh kernel uImage

To update kernel with REA updates (should not have to be done often)
$./build.sh update k

(Or run 
    $git clone -b rzn1-stable https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzn1_linux.git
    to get the latest updates, then build without the script.)

This branch includes the GOAL Core-to-Core (C2C) driver from port GmbH. 
OBSERVE: The C2C driver version must match the GOAL Cortex M3 code version!

Add any files you change, e.g.
$git add output/buildroot-2017.02/configs/rzn1_defconfig [Actually you do not want to change this file.]
$git add output/rzn1_linux/arch/arm/configs/rzn1_defconfig
$git add patches-buildroot/buildroot-2017.02/rzn1_defconf
$git commit
